#+TITLE: Testfiles for SARIT's xml ---> latex (---> pdf) conversion


* Files

1) file:./tests.xml: main test file; xinclude the tests below 
2) file:./parTest.xml: paragraph tests
3) file:./lgTest.xml: line group tests
4) ...: various other test files

The idea is to add *many* of these short test files: their results
should be tracked, so we can see when a change to the XML-->LaTeX
conversion process affects these tests. 

In general, we should try to add many similar, but slightly different,
test files, rather than one big one. After a test case has been added
and the output has been checked to be correct, one should not edit
that file again.
