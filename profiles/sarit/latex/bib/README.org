The file file:./sarit.bib contains the current intermediate for
SARIT's bibliography. The aim is of course to get everything we need
from the TEI files themselves. There is, however, currently no
simple/dependable mechanism that can do this. 

At the moment, therefore, we have decided to live with a hand-crafted
bibliography file. The only requirement is that the keys correspond to
the xml:id-s of the various bibliographic items in the SARIT corpus
(e.g., bibl, biblStruct, msDesc).

The name `sarit.bib' is defined in SARIT's latex conversion
stylesheet, but no path. In order for this to work, you have to put
the file on your path, or simply symlink or copy it into the directory
you're running latex from.
