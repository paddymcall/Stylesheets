The file file:./sarit.bib contains the current intermediate for
SARIT's bibliography.  The aim is of course to get everything we need
from the TEI files themselves. There is, however, currently no
simple/dependable mechanism that can do this.

For the moment, it seems easiest to have a bibliography file in a more
useful format (biblatex, at the moment).  Feel free to add other
formats that seem useful to you.  The only requirement is that the
keys correspond to the xml:id-s of the various bibliographic items in
the SARIT corpus (e.g., bibl, biblStruct, msDesc).

The bibutils commands can be used to convert the .bib file to
different formats, for example MODS:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  bib2xml -i unicode -u sarit.bib > sarit.xml
#+END_SRC

This complains a bit, because the .bib file is for biblatex, and the
bibutils don't really support that yet.
